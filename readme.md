This is a sample directory structure that you can copy in order to build your site. All you have to do is fork and make this the default GitHub Pages branch, or simply copy/clone/download the files here and put them into your own repository. Then, make a markdown file inside of `<repo>/_dms`. Doing so will generate your DM posts, and publish them to your site.
